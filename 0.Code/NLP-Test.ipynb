BUSINESS',\n  'text': 'ITEM 1.  BUSINESS AAR  CORP. and its  subsidiaries are referred to  herein collectively as the\\n\"Company,\" unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company was organized  in\\n1955  as the successor to  a business founded in  1951 and was reincorporated in\\nDelaware in 1966. The  Company supplies a variety  of products and services  for\\naviation in the United States and abroad. Certain  of  the  Company\\'s  aviation-related  activities  and  products are\\nsubject to  licensing,  certification  and other  requirements  imposed  by  the\\nFederal Aviation Administration and other regulatory agencies, both domestic and\\nforeign.  The Company believes that it  has all licenses and certifications that\\nare material to the conduct of its business. The Company\\'s trading activities include the  purchase, sale and lease of  a\\nwide variety of new, used and overhauled aviation products, principally aircraft\\nequipment  such as engines, avionics, accessories, airframe and engine parts and\\ncomponents. The Company also provides customized inventory supply and management\\nprograms  for  certain  aircraft  and  engine  parts  in  support  of   customer\\nmaintenance  activities.  The  Company is  also  a distributor  of  new aviation\\nhardware and  parts. The  Company\\'s  primary sources  of aviation  products  are\\ndomestic  and  foreign  airlines,  independent  aviation  service  companies and\\nairframe, engine  and  other  original equipment  manufacturers.  The  Company\\'s\\ntrading activities also include the purchase, sale, lease and lease financing of\\nnew and used jet aircraft. The Company provides a wide range of services, parts, component exchange and\\nother  products  as  part of  its  overhaul activities.  The  Company overhauls,\\nrepairs and modifies components for commercial and military aircraft,  including\\nlanding  gear and engine  components for most models  of commercial aircraft. It\\nprovides aircraft terminal services (fueling and aircraft storage), maintenance,\\nmodification,  special  equipment   installation  and   painting  services   for\\ncommercial and business aircraft. The   Company  manufactures,  installs   and  repairs  specialized  aviation\\nproducts, including pallets, containers, cargo handling systems and  lightweight\\nair   logistics   shelters,  primarily   for   domestic  and   foreign  military\\norganizations, airframe manufacturers, commercial airlines and others. The Company furnishes Aviation Services directly through its own  employees.\\nDomestic  and foreign  airlines, airframe,  engine and  other original equipment\\nmanufacturers,  aircraft  leasing  companies,  domestic  and  foreign   military\\norganizations  and  independent  aviation support  companies  are  the principal\\ncustomers for the Company\\'s aviation trading activities. Principal customers  of\\nthe  Company\\'s aviation  overhaul activities  are commercial  airlines, aircraft\\nleasing  companies,  business  aircraft  operators,  military  overhaul  depots,\\nmilitary  contractors and  original equipment  manufacturers. Sales  of Aviation\\nServices to commercial airlines  are generally affected by  such factors as  the\\nnumber,  type and  average age  of aircraft in  service, the  levels of aircraft\\nutilization (E.G., frequency of schedules), the number of airline operators  and\\nthe level of sales of new and used aircraft. The  Company is a  leading independent supplier of  Aviation Services to the\\naviation aftermarket,  which  is highly  competitive.  Competition is  based  on\\nquality,  ability to provide  a broad range  of products and  services, speed of\\ndelivery and price. During the past three years, demand for aviation aftermarket\\nproducts and  services declined  as airlines  reduced operations  and  curtailed\\npurchases  to counter the  impact of the airlines\\'  reduced traffic demand which\\nhas not until recently  showed signs of  improvement. Additionally, during  this\\nperiod  many  airlines  continued  experiencing  financial  losses,  and certain\\ncarriers ceased operations. Aggressive price competition among the airlines  has\\nled   carriers  to   continue  to   reduce  costs   and  to   defer  or  curtail 2\\n<PAGE>\\nnonessential spending.  The  ongoing  soft  demand  for  aviation  products  and\\nservices  was exacerbated by increased competition  due to availability of parts\\nremoved from grounded  aircraft and from  entry onto the  market of  inventories\\nfrom  liquidated airlines. Aerospace manufacturers have  over the last few years\\nexperienced reduced demand caused  by cancellations of  new aircraft orders  and\\ngovernment spending cuts reducing their parts support requirements. The  Company competes  with other  independent distributors  and independent\\nsupport  facilities,  as   well  as   with  airlines   and  original   equipment\\nmanufacturers,  including aerospace equipment manufacturers,  some of which have\\ngreater resources than the Company. In certain of its leasing and commercial jet\\naircraft trading  activities,  the  Company  faces  competition  from  financial\\ninstitutions,  syndicators,  commercial  and specialized  leasing  companies and\\nother entities that provide financing, some of which have greater resources than\\nthe Company. The Company believes  it has maintained a satisfactory  competitive\\nposition. In  addition to  its aviation-related  activities, the  Company manufactures\\nhighly engineered proprietary products, including industrial floor cleaning  and\\nmaterials  handling equipment and nuclear  shielding material. The Company sells\\nthese products directly and through  independent distributors to a wide  variety\\nof  commercial customers and  domestic and foreign  governments. The markets for\\nthese products are highly competitive, based on price, quality and availability. At May 31, 1994, backlog believed  to be firm was approximately  $84,550,000\\ncompared  to $77,520,000 at May 31,  1993. An additional $82,620,000 of unfunded\\ngovernment options on  awarded contracts also  existed at May  31, 1994. Of  the\\n1994  year-end backlog that  is firm, $41,460,000  is attributable to government\\ncontracts for  products  related  to  the  U.S.  Government\\'s  rapid  deployment\\nprograms.  It is expected that approximately  $70,523,000 of the backlog will be\\nshipped in fiscal 1995. Sales to the United  States government and  its agencies were  approximately\\n$77,500,000  (19.0% of total net sales),  $57,600,000 (15.0% of total net sales)\\nand $54,000,000  (12.8% of  total net  sales)  in fiscal  1994, 1993  and  1992,\\nrespectively.  Because  such  sales  are  subject  to  competitive  bidding  and\\ngovernment funding, no assurance can be  given that such sales will continue  at\\nlevels   previously  experienced.  The  majority  of  the  Company\\'s  government\\ncontracts are  for  aviation products  and  services used  for  ongoing  routine\\nmilitary  logistic  support activities;  unlike weapons  systems and  other high\\ntechnology military requirements, these products and services are less likely to\\nbe affected by reductions in defense spending. The Company\\'s contracts with  the\\nUnited  States  government and  its agencies  are  typically firm  agreements to\\nprovide aviation products and services at a  fixed price and have a term of  one\\nyear or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods\\nof  one year  at the  option of  the government  agency. Although  the Company\\'s\\ngovernment  contracts  are  subject  to  termination  at  the  election  of  the\\ngovernment,  in the event of such a termination the Company would be entitled to\\nrecover from the government all allowable costs incurred by the Company  through\\nthe date of termination. At May 31, 1994, the Company employed approximately 1,860 persons worldwide.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS\\nOF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The  Company  reports  its  activities  in  one  business  segment: Aviation\\nServices. The table  below sets  forth net sales  for the  Company\\'s classes  of\\nsimilar  products and services  within this segment  for each of  the last three\\nfiscal years ended May 31. THREE-YEAR NET SALES SUMMARY Any comparison of net sales for the last three fiscal years should be viewed\\nin light of the economic weakness of the aerospace/aviation industry during much\\nof this period. The  Company believes that  industry conditions have  stabilized\\nand in certain respects improved toward the end of this time frame. Airlines, in\\ngeneral,  have recently experienced increased  aircraft utilization, seen growth\\nin revenue passenger and  freight miles and posted  modest operating gains.  The\\nCompany  continued  to aggressively  pursue  market opportunities,  resulting in\\nimproved revenues in fiscal 1994. A  decline  in  sales  of  aviation  fasteners,  due  to  lower  demand   by\\naerospace/aviation  manufacturers,  offset  what otherwise  would  have  been an\\nincrease in trading sales  during the three year  period. Further affecting  the\\ndecline in fastener sales was the Company\\'s election not to make significant new\\ninvestments  in inventory for fastener  programs with uncertain return potential\\nin a shrinking market. During this period the Company experienced an increase in\\nengine and airframe parts sales. Fiscal 1994 overhaul sales increased from the  prior year in part due to  an\\nincrease  in  maintenance  services  at the  Company\\'s  Oklahoma  City facility.\\nAdditionally, sales of manufactured products  increased in fiscal 1994 from  the\\nprior  year  due  primarily  to  sales to  the  U.S.  government  for  the rapid\\ndeployment program. The Company believes it  is well positioned to  take advantage of  available\\nopportunities in the improving aerospace/aviation industry. <TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                       FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31,\\n                                                      ----------------------------\\n                                                        1994      1993      1992\\n                                                      --------  --------  --------\\n<S>                                                   <C>       <C>       <C>\\n                                                            (000\\'S OMITTED)\\nNet Sales:\\n  Trading...........................................  $199,433  $202,464  $209,410\\n  Overhaul..........................................   112,100   102,382   115,250\\n  Manufacturing.....................................    96,221    77,934    97,997\\n                                                      --------  --------  --------\\n                                                      $407,754  $382,780  $422,657\\n                                                      --------  --------  --------\\n                                                      --------  --------  --------\\n</TABLE> FISCAL 1994 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1993 The  Company\\'s operating results improved in  fiscal 1994 despite the highly\\ncompetitive and economically  weak aerospace/aviation  market. Consolidated  net\\nsales  for fiscal 1994 increased $24,974,000 or  6.5% over the prior fiscal year\\nprimarily as a result of increased manufacturing and overhaul sales. Net  income\\nincreased  $9,211,000 over the prior year, which included restructuring expenses\\nof $11,000,000  ($7,200,000 after  tax)  related to  the write-down  of  certain\\ninventories.  Excluding restructuring expenses,  net income increased $2,011,000\\nor 26.9%  as the  result of  sales increases  and reduced  selling, general  and\\nadministrative costs. Manufacturing  sales increased $18,287,000 or 23.5%, primarily from the sale\\nof products to the U.S. government. Overhaul sales increased $9,718,000 or  9.5%\\ndue  to increased demand for maintenance  services at the Oklahoma City facility\\nand increased sales of rotable  landing gear inventory. Trading sales  increased\\nin    its   primary   products,    such   as   airframe    and   engine   parts; 8\\n<PAGE>\\nhowever, these gains were  offset by reduced demand  for aviation fasteners  and\\nthe Company\\'s decision not to enter into fastener programs requiring significant\\ninventory  investment  with  uncertain  returns. These  factors  resulted  in an\\noverall decline in trading sales of $3,031,000 or 1.5%. Consolidated gross profit increased $3,474,000  or 5.1% over the prior  year\\nprimarily  due to increased sales revenue. Fiscal 1994 consolidated gross profit\\nincluded $700,000  from  a reduction  in  the  interest rate  on  a  nonrecourse\\nleveraged  lease  obligation  negotiated  by the  Company,  and  $1,300,000 from\\nleveraged lease repricing  required to  adjust for tax  rate differentials.  The\\nconsolidated  gross profit margin  was slightly lower than  the prior year, down\\nfrom 17.9% to 17.6%. Trading and  manufacturing margins improved year over  year\\nwhile  overhaul  margins  declined.  The  overhaul  margin  decline  was  due to\\nincreased price  competition  resulting  from maintenance  overcapacity  in  the\\nindustry  and airlines  using lower-cost  serviceable replacement  components in\\npreference to overhaul services. Consolidated operating  income increased  $16,481,000 over  the prior  year.\\nWithout  the fiscal 1993 restructuring expenses of $11,000,000, operating income\\nincreased $5,481,000  or  33.5% due  primarily  to  the increased  sales  and  a\\nreduction  of  $2,007,000  in  selling, general  and  administrative  costs. The\\nCompany maintained its effort to contain costs, reduce nonessential spending and\\ncreate operating efficiencies wherever possible. Consolidated  net  income  increased  $9,211,000  notwithstanding  increased\\ninterest  expense of $1,457,000  due to higher fixed-rate  interest on debt from\\nthe issuance of  $50 million  of new 7.25%  long-term notes  issued in  October,\\n1993.  Proceeds from this fixed-rate debt  repaid $28 million of short-term bank\\nborrowings at lower interest rates. Higher  margins on fiscal 1994 export  sales\\nreduced  the  effective  tax rate,  which  also  contributed to  the  net income\\nincrease. FISCAL 1993 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1992 Consolidated net sales for fiscal 1993 decreased $39,877,000 or 9% from  the\\nprior  fiscal year. Net income decreased $9,737,000  or 97% as the result of the\\nsales decrease, restructuring expenses of $11,000,000 (or $7,200,000 after  tax)\\nand  a reduction in the consolidated  gross profit margin. The operating results\\nof each major business  activity in fiscal 1993  were adversely impacted by  the\\ncontinued  weak  economic  environment, particularly  in  the aerospace/aviation\\nmarket. Trading activities benefitted from increased sales of its primary  products,\\nsuch  as airframe  and engine  parts. Even  with these  increases, trading sales\\ndecreased $6,946,000  or  3%,  primarily  due to  reduced  demand  for  aviation\\nfasteners.   The  demand  for  fasteners  decreased  due  to  aerospace/aviation\\nmanufacturers\\' reduced requirements  caused by delays  and cancellations of  new\\naircraft   orders  and   government  budget   cuts  affecting   certain  defense\\ncontractors. The  sales  of  overhaul services  decreased  $13,986,000  or  12%,\\nprimarily  as a result of lower demand and the effect of downsizing the Oklahoma\\nCity maintenance facility. The  lower demand was  caused by airlines  downsizing\\ntheir  active fleets and  focusing on lowering  maintenance costs. The resulting\\nmaintenance overcapacity increased  competition which resulted  in lower  prices\\nand  a Company decision not to compete for certain overhaul work. Also, airlines\\nused  lower-cost  serviceable  components,  abundant  in  the  marketplace,   in\\npreference  to overhauling certain units. Simultaneously, the Company took steps\\nwithin its overhaul  activities to reduce  costs. Manufacturing sales  decreased\\n$18,945,000,  or  20%; however,  it should  be noted  that fiscal  1992 included\\n$11,000,000 of non-recurring product sales for the Persian Gulf conflict.  Sales\\nfor  the government\\'s rapid deployment program  increased during fiscal 1993 and\\nthe order backlog was higher at the end  of fiscal 1993 as compared to the  same\\nperiod  in fiscal  1992. Further,  sales were reduced  due to  the reduction and\\ndeferral  of  orders  for  commercial   and  military  aircraft  cargo   systems 9\\n<PAGE>\\nand  spare parts, and  lower sales at the  Company\\'s floor maintenance equipment\\nunit due to a recession-induced decline  in demand, intense competition and  the\\neffect of converting to a direct distribution system in Europe. Consolidated  gross profit  contribution decreased  $15,004,000 or  18% from\\nfiscal 1992 due to  a reduction in  sales and a  decrease in consolidated  gross\\nprofit margin from 19.7% to 17.9%. Lower production and sales levels in relation\\nto  fixed costs at a  few units, as well  as increased competition, hampered the\\nmargin; the  Company\\'s  floor  maintenance  equipment  unit  was  most  affected\\nincurring  a loss for the year.  Following aggressive cost-reduction efforts and\\nan improvement in  sales, operating  performance significantly  improved in  the\\nthird  and fourth quarters. The consolidated gross profit margin benefitted from\\nsales of airframe and engine parts at margins consistent with the prior year and\\nthe effect of cost  reductions at the Oklahoma  City maintenance facility.  Cost\\nreductions  implemented  company  wide  during  fiscal  1993  benefitted ongoing\\noperations. The Company reduced selling, general and administrative expenses  $4,817,000\\nor  8% in response to a decrease in sales and competitive market conditions. The\\nCompany continued its  focus on  cost containment and  improvement in  operating\\nefficiencies in an effort to maintain its operating margins. In  February, 1993  the Company  recorded noncash  restructuring expenses of\\n$11,000,000 for the writedown of  certain inventories and associated costs.  The\\ninventories  most  affected  were  parts  for  older-model  commercial aircraft,\\ncertain  manufactured  products  and  material  supporting  original   equipment\\nmanufacturers.  The  writedown resulted  from  the Company\\'s  assessment  of the\\nimpact on  inventories of  then very  recent changes  in the  aerospace/aviation\\nmarket,  as well as the continued recessionary environment. The Company believes\\nthe  reduction  in  inventory  value  improved  its  competitive  position   and\\nfacilitated sale of the inventories. The  income tax  benefit of $2,200,000  reported in fiscal  1993 included an\\nexpense reduction of $1,200,000 from the reversal of income tax liabilities. The\\nincome tax benefit before the expense reduction was higher than that  determined\\nusing  the statutory  rate as  the result  of state  income tax  refunds and the\\neffect of tax benefits on exempt  earnings from export sales. The provision  for\\nincome  taxes  in fiscal  1992  was lower  than  the amount  computed  using the\\nstatutory Federal income  tax rate  due to  tax benefits  generated from  export\\nsales  and an income tax  expense reduction of $700,000.  The income tax expense\\nreductions were  for income  tax liabilities  recorded in  prior years,  but  no\\nlonger  required due to  the conclusion by  the Internal Revenue  Service of its\\nexamination of the Company\\'s Federal income tax returns for prior years. Fourth quarter fiscal 1993 sales decreased  $8,009,000 or 7% as compared  to\\nthe  same quarter  of the  prior year;  however, net  income increased $300,000.\\nSales and earnings continued  to be impacted by  adverse market conditions.  The\\nfourth  quarter fiscal  1993 operating results  improved from  the third quarter\\nfiscal 1993 as  the result of  a 22%  increase in consolidated  sales and  lower\\noperating  costs.  Fiscal  1992\\'s  fourth  quarter  operating  results  included\\nrestructuring expenses of $5,800,000,  or $3,800,000 after  tax, related to  the\\nOklahoma City maintenance facility. FISCAL 1992 Consolidated  net sales decreased $43,885,000 or 9% primarily as a result of\\na cessation  of shipments  of manufactured  logistics support  products for  the\\nAllied Coalition in the Persian Gulf conflict and reduced sales at the Company\\'s\\nOklahoma  City maintenance facility amounting to  $53,000,000 in the prior year.\\nThese reductions were partially  mitigated by increases  in certain trading  and\\noverhaul  activities stemming  from the  provisioning of  transitioned aircraft,\\nmaintenance part  activities, and  component  overhaul activities,  despite  the\\ndifficult   economic   environment   and  airline   customer\\'s   curtailment  of\\nnonessential spending. 10\\n<PAGE>\\n    Consolidated operating  income decreased  $9,671,000  primarily due  to  the\\nreductions  in consolidated net sales described above and restructuring expenses\\nof $5,800,000 recorded for restructuring and reduction in size of the  Company\\'s\\nOklahoma  City maintenance  facility. The  reduction in  the overhaul subsidiary\\nresulted from continued operating losses  being experienced by an  industry-wide\\novercapacity  for  certain  maintenance  services,  which  led  to  facility and\\nworkforce underutilization. Consolidated net  income decreased  $4,781,000  as a  result of  the  events\\nimpacting  consolidated  net  sales and  the  restructuring  expenses previously\\ndescribed. The impact of these events were moderated by interest expense savings\\nattributed to a decline in short-term  interest rates and a lower provision  for\\nincome  taxes  resulting from  tax benefits  generated from  export sales  and a\\nreduction of previously recorded tax liabilities  no longer required due to  the\\nconclusion  by the Internal Revenue Service of its examination of previous years\\nFederal income tax returns of the Company. FINANCIAL CONDITION AT MAY 31, 1994 COMPARED WITH MAY 31, 1993 In fiscal 1994, the Company\\'s primary sources of liquidity were the proceeds\\nof $50,000,000 from the issuance of  7.25% unsecured ten-year notes in  October,\\n1993  and cash  provided from  operations of  $6,697,000. The  proceeds from the\\nissuance of the notes were used  to repay all outstanding short-term bank  debt,\\nthus  making available to  the Company the  full amount of  its credit lines and\\nborrowing facilities. The  balance of the  note proceeds were  used for  working\\ncapital  requirements,  primarily inventory  and  accounts receivable.  Net cash\\nprovided from operating activities decreased $10,109,000 in fiscal 1994 from the\\nprior year  as a  result  of new  inventory  investments to  support  government\\ncontracts  and deposits made on  purchases of inventory (see  note 7 in Notes to\\nConsolidated  Financial  Statements)  to  support  new  inventory   provisioning\\ncontracts  entered into  during fiscal  1994. Cash  provided in  excess of these\\nrequirements was used primarily for capital expenditures and to pay dividends. The Company\\'s financial  condition remains solid.  The Company improved  its\\ncurrent ratio and working capital position during the year in spite of operating\\nin  an  aerospace/aviation industry  that continued  to be  financially troubled\\nalthough improving.  The Company\\'s  improved financial  condition and  available\\nsources  of financing,  including its  unused bank  credit lines  and facilities\\namounting to  $132,500,000, will  enable  the Company  to meet  its  anticipated\\nworking capital requirements and pursue advantageous business opportunities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The  accompanying consolidated financial statements  include the accounts of\\nthe Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts  and\\ntransactions. REVENUE RECOGNITION Sales  and related cost  of sales are recognized  primarily upon shipment of\\nproducts and  performance  of services.  Sales  and  related cost  of  sales  on\\nlong-term  contracts are  recognized as units  are delivered,  determined by the\\npercentage of completion method based on  the relationship of costs incurred  to\\ndate  to estimated total costs under  the respective contracts. Lease revenue is\\nrecognized as earned. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Effective  June  1,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of   Financial\\nAccounting  Standards  (\"SFAS\") No.  109  \"Accounting for  Income  Taxes.\" Prior\\nyears\\' results were not restated. The cumulative effect of the accounting change\\nwas a tax  benefit of  $900,000 ($.06  per share)  recorded in  the three  month\\nperiod ended August 31, 1993. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 changes the Company\\'s\\nmethod  of accounting  for income taxes  from the deferred  method of Accounting\\nPrinciples Board Opinion  (\"APB\") No. 11  to the asset  and liability method  of\\naccounting.  Under  the  asset and  liability  method, deferred  tax  assets and\\nliabilities  are   recognized  for   the  estimated   future  tax   consequences\\nattributable  to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of\\nexisting assets and  liabilities and  their respective tax  bases. Deferred  tax\\nassets  and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates in effect for the\\nyear in  which those  temporary  differences are  expected  to be  recovered  or\\nsettled.  The effect on deferred  tax assets and liabilities  of a change in tax\\nrates will  be recognized  in the  consolidated results  of operations  for  the\\nperiod  in which the changes occurred. Pursuant to the deferred method under APB\\nNo. 11, which was  applied in 1993  and prior years,  deferred income taxes  are\\nrecognized for income and expense items that are reported in different years for\\nfinancial  reporting and income  tax purposes using the  tax rate applicable for\\nthe year  of calculation.  Under the  deferred method,  deferred taxes  are  not\\nadjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates. Effective  June  1,  1993,  the Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  106 \"Employers\\'\\nAccounting for  Postretirement  Benefits  Other  than  Pensions.\"  Prior  years\\'\\nresults  were not restated. SFAS No. 106 requires that the projected future cost\\nof nonpension postretirement benefits be  recognized as an expense as  employees\\nrender  services instead of when claims are incurred, as the Company had done in\\nthe past. Upon adoption, the Company  elected, as permitted under SFAS No.  106,\\nto  record a one-time transition obligation of $1,350,000 ($890,000 after tax or\\n$.06 per share) which  represents that portion of  future retiree benefit  costs\\nrelated  to service already rendered by both  active and retired employees up to\\nthe date of adoption. The initial accumulated postretirement benefit  obligation\\nof  $1,350,000  primarily represented  health  and life  insurance  benefits for\\ncertain current employees and retirees. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three\\nmonths or less  to be  cash equivalents.  At May  31, 1994  cash equivalents  of\\napproximately  $5,717,000  held by  the Company  represent investments  in funds\\nholding  high-quality  commercial   paper,  Eurodollars   and  U.S.   government\\nagency-issued  securities. The carrying amount  of cash equivalents approximates\\nfair value at May 31, 1994. 19\\n<PAGE>\\n                           AAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED) 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)\\n  MARKETABLE SECURITIES The Company recorded net proceeds of $1,593,000 in fiscal 1993 from the sale\\nof marketable securities  and included a  $57,000 net loss  in the  consolidated\\nresults  of  operations.  Marketable securities  were  carried at  the  lower of\\naggregate cost or market value. FOREIGN CURRENCY Gains and  losses  on  foreign currency  translation  and  foreign  exchange\\ncontracts  are determined in accordance with the method of accounting prescribed\\nby SFAS  No.  52.  All  balance  sheet  accounts  of  foreign  subsidiaries  are\\ntranslated  at year-end exchange rates. Revenues  and expenses are translated at\\naverage exchange rates  during the  year. Translation  adjustments are  excluded\\nfrom  the  results of  operations and  are recorded  in Stockholders\\'  equity as\\nCumulative translation adjustments. The Company from time to time uses forward exchange contracts or options  to\\nhedge  its loss exposure from the translation of foreign subsidiaries results of\\noperations from  functional  currencies  into  United  States  dollars.  Forward\\nexchange  contracts or options  losses are included in  results of operations in\\nthe period  the loss  is determinable.  Gains are  recorded when  realized  upon\\ncontract settlement. At May 31, 1994 there were no forward exchange contracts or\\noptions  outstanding. Foreign  subsidiaries incur  transaction gains  and losses\\nupon settlement  of  obligations  in  currencies  other  than  their  functional\\ncurrency.  The aggregate net transaction gains (losses), including those related\\nto forward exchange contracts, reported in results of operations were $(32,000),\\n$(578,000) and $25,000 for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF MARKET OR CREDIT RISK Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations\\nof market or credit  risk consist principally of  forward exchange contracts  or\\noptions  and trade receivables.  The forward exchange  contracts discussed above\\nsubject the Company to  market risk from  exchange rate movements.  Accordingly,\\nthe  Company recognizes losses in the period such losses are determinable. While\\nthe Company\\'s trade receivables are diverse based on the number of entities  and\\ngeographic  locations, the  majority are concentrated  in the aerospace/aviation\\nindustry. The  Company performs  evaluations of  customers\\' financial  condition\\nprior to extending credit privileges and performs on-going credit evaluations of\\npayment  experience, current financial condition, and risk analysis. The Company\\ntypically requires  collateral  in the  form  of security  interest  in  assets,\\nletters  of  credit, or  obligation guarantees  from financial  institutions for\\ntransactions other than normal trade terms. SFAS No.  107  \"Disclosures  About Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments,\"\\nrequires  disclosure of the  fair value of  certain financial instruments. Cash,\\naccounts  receivable,  short-term  borrowing,   accounts  payable  and   accrued\\nliabilities  are reflected in the financial  statements at fair value because of\\nthe short-term maturity of these instruments. Marketable securities are recorded\\nin  the  financial  statements  at  current  market  values.  Non-current  notes\\nreceivable  and long-term debt bearing a variable interest rate are reflected in\\nthe financial statements at fair value. Those bearing a fixed interest rate have\\nfair values based on estimates using discounted future cash flows at an  assumed\\ndiscount  rate for borrowing currently prevailing in the marketplace for similar\\ninstruments. 20\\n<PAGE>\\n                           AAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED) 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)\\n    Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant\\nmarket  information  about  the   financial  instrument.  These  estimates   are\\nsubjective  in  nature  and  involve uncertainties  and  matters  of significant\\njudgement  and  therefore  cannot  be  determined  with  precision.  Changes  in\\nassumptions could significantly affect the estimates. INVENTORIES Inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by\\neither  the specific  identification or first-in,  first-out method. Inventoried\\ncosts relating to  long-term contracts  and programs  are stated  at the  actual\\nproduction  costs,  including factory  burden and  initial tooling,  incurred to\\ndate, reduced by amounts identified with revenue recognized on units  delivered.\\nThe  costs attributed to units delivered  under long-term contracts and programs\\nare based on the estimated average cost  of all units scheduled to be  produced.\\nProgress   billings  under  government  contracts  are  based  on  an  allowable\\npercentage of  the  cost of  material  received  and labor  and  factory  burden\\nincurred.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Depreciation is computed on  the straight-line method  over useful lives  of\\n10-40  years  for  buildings  and improvements  and  3-10  years  for equipment,\\nfurniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the  estimated\\nuseful life or the term of the applicable lease. 21\\n<PAGE>\\n                           AAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED) 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)\\n    Repairs  and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or\\ndisposal, cost and accumulated  depreciation are removed  from the accounts  and\\nrelated gains and losses included in results of operations. LEVERAGED LEASES The  Company acts as an equity  participant in leveraged lease transactions.\\nThe equipment cost in excess of equity contribution is furnished by third  party\\nfinancing  in the form  of secured debt.  Under the lease  agreements, the third\\nparties have no recourse against the Company for non-payment of the obligations.\\nThe third party debt  is collateralized by the  lessees\\' rental obligations  and\\nthe  leased equipment. The Company has ownership rights to the leased assets and\\nis entitled to the  investment tax credits, and  benefits of tax deductions  for\\ndepreciation  on  the  leased  assets  and  for  interest  on  the  secured debt\\nfinancing. COST IN EXCESS OF UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES The cost in excess of underlying  net assets of companies acquired is  being\\namortized  over a period of forty years. Amortization was $240,000, $240,000 and\\n$228,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993  and 1992, respectively. Accumulated  amortization\\nis  $2,950,000,  $2,710,000  and $2,470,000  at  May  31, 1994,  1993  and 1992,\\nrespectively. INCOME TAXES Income taxes  are determined  in accordance  with the  method of  accounting\\nprescribed by SFAS No. 109. Federal  income  taxes are  not provided  on  the undistributed  earnings of\\ncertain foreign subsidiaries (approximately  $14,600,000 and $13,300,000 at  May\\n31, 1994 and 1993, respectively), as it is the Company\\'s intention to reinvest a\\nportion  of these earnings indefinitely in  the foreign operations. From time to\\ntime, as the earnings are treated as  taxable in the United States, the  related\\ntax expense would be offset substantially by foreign tax credits. Foreign income\\ntaxes  are provided  at the  local statutory  rates and  reflect estimated taxes\\npayable.

The  balance  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  arises  from  the\\ndifferences  in the timing of the  recognition for transactions between book and\\nincome tax purposes and consists of the following components: <TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                                             MAY 31,\\n                                                                              1994\\n                                                                             -------\\n                                                                             (000\\'S\\n                                                                             OMITTED)\\n<S>                                                                          <C>\\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\n  Depreciation.............................................................  $9,710\\n  Leveraged leases.........................................................  28,560\\n  Other....................................................................     730\\n                                                                             -------\\n      Total deferred tax liabilities.......................................  $39,000\\n                                                                             -------\\n                                                                             -------\\nDeferred tax assets-current:\\n  Inventory costs..........................................................  $7,800\\n  Employee benefits........................................................     900\\n  Doubtful account allowance...............................................     780\\n  Other....................................................................      50\\n                                                                             -------\\n      Total deferred tax assets-current....................................   9,530\\n                                                                             -------\\nDeferred tax assets-noncurrent:\\n  Postretirement benefits..................................................   1,050\\n  Restructuring expenses...................................................     960\\n  Alternative minimum tax credits..........................................   4,540\\n  Other....................................................................      60\\n                                                                             -------\\n      Total deferred tax assets-noncurrent.................................   6,610\\n                                                                             -------\\n      Total deferred tax assets............................................  $16,140\\n                                                                             -------\\n                                                                             -------\\n</TABLE> 25\\n<PAGE>\\n                           AAR CORP.

The years are now\\nclosed to assessments, therefore certain tax accruals previously provided are no\\nlonger required. The fiscal 1993 income tax benefit before the reversal of tax liabilities on\\nconsolidated pre-tax income was higher than the statutory rate primarily as  the\\nresult  of state income tax  refunds received and the  effect of tax benefits on\\nexempt earnings from export sales.  Pretax income from foreign subsidiaries  was\\napproximately  $1,300,000, $1,200,000 and  $2,300,000 at May  31, 1994, 1993 and\\n1992, respectively. Total foreign income taxes provided were in excess of  total\\nlocal  statutory rates in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 due to net operating losses\\nof certain subsidiaries not deductible for tax purposes. 26\\n<PAGE>\\n                           AAR CORP.

The number of shares and the  restricted period, which varies from two\\nto ten  years, are  determined by  the Compensation  Committee of  the Board  of\\nDirectors.  The market value of the award on  the date of grant is recorded as a\\ndeferred expense,  common stock  and capital  surplus. The  deferred expense  is\\nincluded in results of operations over the restricted term.

The Rights become exercisable (and separate from the shares) when\\ncertain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 20% or more of  the\\ncommon stock by a person or group (an \"Acquiring Person\") or the commencement of\\na tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of the Common Stock. In  the event that  an Acquiring Person  acquires 20% or  more of the Common\\nStock, or if the Company is the  surviving corporation in a merger involving  an\\nAcquiring  Person,  or  if the  Acquiring  Person  engages in  certain  types of\\nself-dealing transactions, each Right  entitles the holder  to purchase for  $85\\n(or the then current exercise price) shares of the Company\\'s Common Stock having\\na  market value of  $170 (or two  times the exercise  price), subject to certain\\nexceptions. Similarly, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other  business\\ncombination  or 50% or more  of its assets or earning  power is sold, each Right\\nentitles the holder to purchase at  the then current exercise price that  number\\nof  shares of Common Stock of the surviving corporation having a market value of\\ntwo times  the exercise  price. The  Rights,  which do  not entitle  the  holder\\nthereof  to vote or  to receive dividends, expire  on August 6,  1997 and may be\\nredeemed by the Company for $.01 per Right under certain circumstances. On September 21,  1990, the  Board of  Directors authorized  the Company  to\\npurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company\\'s Common Stock on the open market\\nor through privately negotiated transactions. As of May 31, 1994 the Company had\\npurchased  308,927 shares of Common Stock on  the open market under this program\\nat an average price of $11.51 per share. 5.  NET INCOME PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK Primary net  income per  share is  computed by  dividing net  income by  the\\nweighted  average number of shares of  common stock and common stock equivalents\\noutstanding during the year. Shares granted as restricted stock awards under The\\nAAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan are considered outstanding from the date of  grant.\\nCommon  Stock equivalents consist of the  average number of shares issuable upon\\nthe exercise of  all dilutive  employee stock  options, less  the common  shares\\nwhich  could  have  been purchased,  at  the  average market  price  during each\\nquarter, with the assumed proceeds from the exercise of the options. 6.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS -- (CONTINUED)\\n  DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS The pension  plans for  domestic salaried  employees have  benefit  formulas\\nbased  primarily on years  of service and compensation.  The pension benefit for\\nhourly employees is generally based on a  fixed amount per year of service.  The\\nCompany  follows  the  provisions of  SFAS  No. 87,  \"Employers\\'  Accounting for\\nPensions,\" for all domestic operations. The Company\\'s funding policy for  domestic plans is to contribute  annually,\\nat  a minimum, an amount which is deductible for Federal income tax purposes and\\nthat is sufficient to meet actuarially computed pension benefits.  Contributions\\nare  intended to  provide for  benefits attributed  to service  to date  and for\\nbenefits expected to be earned  in the future. The  assets of the pension  plans\\nare  invested primarily in  mutual funds, common  stocks, investment grade bonds\\nand United States government obligations. Certain international subsidiaries also have  pension plans. In most  cases,\\nthe  plans are defined benefit  in nature. Assets of  the plans are comprised of\\ninsurance contracts. Benefit formulas are similar  to those used by U.S.  plans.\\nIt  is the  policy of these  subsidiaries to  fund at least  the minimum amounts\\nrequired by local law and regulation.

LONG TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN The long term performance incentive plan is administered by the Compensation\\nCommittee of the Board of Directors.  The plan provides for incentive awards  to\\ncertain key employees designated by the Compensation Committee based on the long\\nterm  performance of the Company. No awards were earned under the Plan in fiscal\\n1994, 1993 nor 1992, therefore, no expense was charged to results of operations. SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Supplemental Retirement agreements provide  benefits to certain current  and\\nformer  key employees. During  fiscal 1993 and 1992,  $260,000 and $570,000 were\\ndeposited into trust funds for payment of these benefits. The amounts are  being\\namortized  over the remaining terms of employment.

At May 31, 1994, the trust fund assets\\nwere adequate to provide for the estimated retirement benefits. BOARD OF DIRECTORS\\' RETIREMENT PLAN The  Company adopted a Directors\\' Retirement  Plan for its outside directors\\nin April,  1992. The  Plan provides  for  a benefit  to outside  directors  upon\\nretirement  on or after age 65 provided  they have completed at least five years\\nof service as  a director. Benefits  are payable  as a quarterly  annuity in  an\\namount  equal to 25% of the annual retainer fee payable by the Company to active\\noutside directors. Payment of benefits  commences upon retirement and  continues\\nfor  a  period equal  to the  total number  of years  of the  retired director\\'s\\nservice as a  director to a  maximum of  ten years, or  death, whichever  occurs\\nfirst.  The Directors\\' Retirement  Plan is unfunded,  with costs and obligations\\nrecognized in  accordance  with SFAS  No.  87.  Expense charged  to  results  of\\noperations was $75,000 and $120,000 in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS The Company provides health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible\\nemployees  and retirees under  a variety of plans.  Generally these benefits are\\ncontributory, with retiree contributions  adjusted annually. The  postretirement\\nplans  are unfunded and the Company has the  right to modify or terminate any of\\nthese plans  in  the  future,  in certain  cases  subject  to  union  bargaining\\nagreements. Effective  June  1,  1993,  the Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  106 \"Employers\\'\\nAccounting for Postretirement  Benefits Other  Than Pensions.\"  Prior to  fiscal\\nyear 1994, the Company recognized retiree health and life insurance expense when\\nbenefits  were paid. Prior years\\' results  were not restated. Upon adoption, the\\nCompany elected  to  record  a  one-time  transition  obligation  of  $1,350,000\\n($890,000  after tax)  which represents that  portion of  future retiree benefit\\ncosts related to service already rendered  by both active and retired  employees\\nup to the date of adoption.

The assumed rate of future increases in health care\\ncosts was 10.0% in fiscal 1994, declining to 6.0% by the year 2004 and remaining\\nat  that rate thereafter. A one percent increase in the assumed health care cost\\ntrend  rate  would  increase   the  accumulated  postretirement  obligation   by\\napproximately  $100,000 as of May 31, 1994 and would not result in a significant\\nchange to the annual postretirement benefit expense. 7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\\n    The Company  leases  certain  facilities under  agreements  that  expire  at\\nvarious  dates through 2011.  Rental expense under  these leases was $4,840,000,\\n$5,320,000 and $4,850,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Future minimum payments under leases with initial or remaining terms of  one\\nyear  or more at  May 31, 1994  were $4,820,000 for  fiscal 1995, $3,490,000 for\\nfiscal 1996,  $3,310,000  for  fiscal  1997,  $2,850,000  for  fiscal  1998  and\\n$10,310,000 for fiscal 1999 and thereafter. The   Company  regularly  places  deposits   with  suppliers  on  short-term\\ncommitments to purchase inventory. These conditional contractual commitments are\\nmade in  the ordinary  course  of business.  At May  31,  1994 the  Company  had\\n$10,700,000 of deposits outstanding with suppliers. The  Company is involved in various claims  and legal actions arising in the\\nordinary course  of  business.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  the  ultimate\\ndisposition  of these  matters will  not have a  material adverse  effect on the\\nCompany\\'s consolidated financial condition. 32\\n<PAGE>\\n                           AAR CORP.

RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES\\n    The  Company recorded noncash restructuring  expenses of $11,000,000 for the\\nwritedown of  certain  inventories and  associated  costs in  fiscal  1993.  The\\ninventories  most  affected  were  parts  for  older-model  commercial aircraft,\\ncertain manufactured products as well as material supporting original  equipment\\nmanufacturers.  The  writedown resulted  from  the Company\\'s  assessment  of the\\nimpact on inventories of  the changes in the  aviation/aerospace market and  the\\nrecessionary  economic  environment.  The  noncash  restructuring  expenses that\\nestablished inventory realization reserves (see note 13 in Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements) had a remaining balance of approximately $4,488,000 at May\\n31, 1994. As the inventory for  which the realization reserves were  established\\nis  disposed  of,  the  realization reserve  balance  is  to  be correspondingly\\nreduced. The Company recorded expenses of $5,800,000  in fiscal 1992 relating to  the\\nrestructuring  of its Oklahoma City  maintenance facility. The expenses included\\nthe excess  of net  book  over estimated  recoverable  value of  idle  leasehold\\nimprovements   and  equipment,  excess   inventory  and  uncollectible  accounts\\nreceivable, as well as  related personnel termination  costs and other  facility\\nreduction expenses. These expenses had been fully realized as of May 31, 1994. 12. AIRCRAFT LEASING ACTIVITIES\\n    The  Company  is an  owner participant  in  four leveraged  lease agreements\\nentered into between March 1986 and May 1988. These agreements cover four narrow\\nbody commercial  aircraft and  spare parts.  The transactions  involve  aircraft\\ncurrently  operated by major  carriers. The remaining terms  of the leases range\\nfrom 7 to 10 years. The Company\\'s equity investment in these aircraft represents\\napproximately one third of the  aggregate equipment cost. The remaining  portion\\nof the equipment cost is financed by third-party nonrecourse debt. The  Company has ownership rights  to the equipment subject  to the right of\\nthe lessees to exercise certain  purchase, renewal and termination options.  For\\nFederal income tax purposes, the Company receives investment tax credits and has\\nthe  benefit of tax deductions for  depreciation on the aggregate equipment cost\\nand  interest   on   the  nonrecourse   debt.

AIRCRAFT LEASING ACTIVITIES -- (CONTINUED)\\nthe  lease  Federal  income tax  deductions  exceeded the  lease  rental income,\\nallowing excess deductions to be applied against the Company\\'s other income.  In\\nthe  later years of  the lease, rental  income exceeds the  deductions and taxes\\nwill be recorded in accordance with  SFAS No. 109. Further, deferred taxes  were\\nprovided  net of the Company\\'s Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) position. In fiscal\\n1994, the Company\\'s  Investment in leveraged  leases was repriced  approximately\\n$2,000,000 for the impact of an interest rate reduction on nonrecourse long-term\\ndebt  secured by aircraft under  leveraged lease, the tax  rate change under the\\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act of  1993 and  the Company\\'s  AMT position  in\\naccordance with SFAS No. 13 \"Accounting for Leases.\" In  August 1990, the  Company sold a  partial residual interest  in a Boeing\\n737-300 aircraft currently subject to a leveraged lease. The lease term  expires\\nin  March  2001. The  principal  portion of  the  proceeds from  this  sale were\\nreceived in the form of a $2,000,000  note and are included with Prepaid  income\\ntaxes,  retirement  benefits, notes  receivable  and other  on  the Consolidated\\nBalance Sheets. This note  has an interest  rate of 9.9%.  The note and  accrued\\ninterest  of $3,600,000 are due  in March 2001. The  carrying amount of the note\\nreceivable approximates its fair value at May 31, 1994.
